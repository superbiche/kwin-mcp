## [Unreleased]

### Security
- Require lifecycle tests to run through the tracked bubblewrap runner; refuse direct host pytest runs.
- Make screenshot output directories explicit and close live-session D-Bus probes.
- Remove shared screenshot-directory defaults and track directory ownership independently of session metadata; borrowed paths are never recursively removed.
- Observe exited process-group leaders without reaping until group cleanup finishes, preventing stale PID signalling.
- Require absolute Wayland socket paths for foreign live D-Bus sessions.
- Route `keyboard_type_unicode` through the selected Wayland session; enforce clipboard opt-in and own/verify foreground clipboard helpers.
- Stop launched application process groups in virtual and live sessions, including termination-resistant descendants; clean up on CLI exit and MCP stdio disconnect.
- Bound virtual-session startup, preserve existing sockets, and clean up failed startup and EIS initialization.
- Refresh locked dependencies and require a patched MCP 1.x SDK.

### Changed
- Add configurable application shutdown grace to `session_stop` (default5 seconds, range0–60).
- Document that virtual sessions and temporary HOME directories are not filesystem or network sandboxes; add lifecycle regression tests.

### Fixed

- Segfault on Python 3.14 caused by missing `argtypes` on variadic `ei_seat_bind_capabilities` ctypes call

## [0.7.0] - 2026-03-29

### Added

- `session_connect` tool for attaching to an existing KWin session (real desktop or container) instead of creating an isolated virtual one. Defaults to `$DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS` and `$WAYLAND_DISPLAY` from the environment. Clipboard is always enabled for live sessions.
- `--default-live-session` flag for both MCP server (`kwin-mcp`) and CLI (`kwin-mcp-cli`) to switch the default session mode from virtual to live. When active, `session_connect` becomes the recommended tool and `session_start` requires explicit invocation.
- `LiveSession` class in `session.py` for managing connections to existing KWin compositors without lifecycle management
- `SessionType` enum (`VIRTUAL` / `LIVE`) and `session_type` field on `SessionInfo` for distinguishing session types

### Changed

- `session_stop` now only disconnects (without killing KWin or pre-existing apps) when used with live sessions
- Error messages for missing sessions now mention both `session_start` and `session_connect`
- Clipboard error messages now mention `session_connect` as an alternative (clipboard is always enabled for live sessions)
- Tool count increased from 29 to 30

## [0.6.0] - 2026-02-25

### Added

- `isolate_home` option in `session_start` to create a temporary HOME directory with isolated XDG directories (`XDG_CONFIG_HOME`, `XDG_DATA_HOME`, `XDG_CACHE_HOME`, `XDG_STATE_HOME`), preventing apps from reading/writing host user settings
- `keep_home` option in `session_start` to preserve the isolated home directory after `session_stop`, useful for inspecting app-generated config/data files
- `list_windows` now shows per-window titles and `[active]`/`[focused]` state markers using AT-SPI2 `ACTIVE`/`FOCUSED` states
- `states` parameter for `find_ui_elements` to filter elements by AT-SPI2 states (e.g. `["focused"]`, `["active", "visible"]`). Query can be empty when filtering by states only.
- `expected_states` parameter for `wait_for_element` to wait until elements have specific AT-SPI2 states (e.g. wait for a window to become `["active"]`)
- `role` parameter for `accessibility_tree` to filter the tree to specific element types (e.g. `"button"`, `"check box"`). Non-matching elements are hidden but their children are still traversed.

### Changed

- AT-SPI2 subprocess queries (`_run_atspi`) now retry once on failure with a 0.5s delay, improving resilience against transient AT-SPI2 bus instability
- `find_ui_elements` and `wait_for_element` result messages now include a descriptive search summary with all filter criteria (query, states)

## [0.5.1] - 2026-02-23

### Fixed

- `session_start` `screen_width`/`screen_height` parameters were being ignored — now correctly passed as `--width`/`--height` flags to `kwin_wayland`

### Added

- `keep_screenshots` option in `session_start` to preserve screenshot files after `session_stop`, useful for debugging and CI artifact collection
- SEO documentation guidelines in `CLAUDE.md`, `docs-seo` custom agent, `release-notes` skill, GitHub issue/PR templates, and `CONTRIBUTING.md`

## [0.5.0] - 2026-02-23

### Added

- **`AutomationEngine` (`core.py`)**: MCP-independent automation logic extracted from `server.py` into a standalone reusable class covering session, input, screenshot, and accessibility operations
- **Interactive CLI (`kwin-mcp-cli`)**: New entry point with REPL and pipe mode for testing all 29 tools without an MCP client

### Changed

- `server.py` simplified to thin MCP wrappers delegating to `AutomationEngine`
- Improved AT-SPI2 bus address propagation and reduced launcher sleep time

## [0.4.2] - 2026-02-22

### Changed

- Added JSON Schema `description` fields to all parameters across all 29 MCP tools for improved discoverability and client-side documentation
- Rewrote `README.md` with complete tool reference tables, architecture diagram, and SEO-optimized metadata

## [0.4.1] - 2026-02-22

### Fixed

- Explicitly pass `KWIN_WAYLAND_NO_PERMISSION_CHECKS` and `KWIN_SCREENSHOT_NO_PERMISSION_CHECKS` env vars directly to the KWin process in the wrapper script — environment inheritance through `dbus-run-session` was unreliable, causing restricted Wayland protocols (e.g. `org_kde_plasma_window_management`) and `X-KDE-Wayland-Interfaces` desktop file declarations to not take effect

## [0.4.0] - 2026-02-22

### Added

- **Restricted Wayland protocol access**: Set `KWIN_WAYLAND_NO_PERMISSION_CHECKS=1` in isolated sessions, enabling clients to bind `org_kde_plasma_window_management` and other KWin-restricted protocols — critical for testing apps that use Plasma's TasksModel / window management APIs
- **App stdout/stderr capture**: `launch_app` and `session_start` now redirect app output to per-app log files, with a new `read_app_log` MCP tool to retrieve logs by PID
- **Wayland protocol diagnostics**: New `wayland_info` MCP tool runs `wayland-info` inside the session to enumerate exposed Wayland globals (useful for verifying protocol availability)
- **Environment variable passthrough**: `session_start` and `launch_app` now accept an `env` parameter for passing extra environment variables to launched apps
- **Shell-aware command parsing**: Commands are now parsed with `shlex.split()` instead of `str.split()`, correctly handling quoted arguments (e.g. `bash -c 'echo hello world'`)

### Changed

- `Session.launch_app()` now returns `AppInfo` (with pid, command, log_path) instead of a bare `int` PID
- `SessionInfo` now tracks all launched apps via an `apps` dict keyed by PID

## [0.3.0] - 2026-02-22

### Added

- M5.1 E2E input features: touch input (tap, swipe, pinch, multi-finger swipe), clipboard (get/set), Unicode text input (wtype/wl-copy fallback), window management (launch_app, list_windows, focus_window), `dbus_call`, and `wait_for_element` — 17 new MCP tools total

### Fixed

- External binary missing errors now return helpful install instructions instead of raw `FileNotFoundError` (affects `wl-clipboard`, `wtype`, `dbus-send`, `spectacle`)

## [0.2.0] - 2026-02-20

### Added

- **Composite frame capture**: Action tools (`mouse_click`, `mouse_move`, `mouse_drag`, `keyboard_type`, `keyboard_key`) now accept an optional `screenshot_after_ms` parameter to capture screenshots at specified delays (in milliseconds) after the action completes
- Fast D-Bus screenshot capture via KWin ScreenShot2 interface (~30-70ms per frame vs ~200-300ms with spectacle CLI)
- Optimized burst capture with two-phase pipeline: raw frame capture with accurate timing, then deferred PNG encoding
- `KWIN_SCREENSHOT_NO_PERMISSION_CHECKS=1` environment variable automatically set for isolated sessions to enable direct D-Bus screenshot access

## [0.1.0] - 2026-02-20

### Added

- Isolated KWin Wayland session management (`session_start`, `session_stop`)
- Screenshot capture via KWin's ScreenShot2 D-Bus interface
- Accessibility tree inspection using AT-SPI2
- UI element search by name, role, or description
- Mouse input: click, move, scroll, drag via KWin EIS (Emulated Input Server)
- Keyboard input: text typing and key combinations via KWin EIS
- FastMCP-based MCP server with stdio transport
